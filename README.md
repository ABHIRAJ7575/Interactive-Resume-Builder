## What Is This?

A resume builder that lets you create professional-looking resumes that ATS systems will still ignore. Features live preview so you can watch your dreams take shape before they get auto-rejected by robots.

Built with vanilla JavaScript because adding React to a resume builder would be the most "overqualified but somehow still rejected" thing ever.

## Features (Bold Claims Edition)

**Live Preview** 👀  
Watch your resume update in real-time! It's like seeing your career hopes manifest, except you can actually control this.

**Smart Typing** ⌨️  
- `Enter` → Next field (just like life pushing you forward)
- `Shift + Enter` → New line (because your achievements need bullet points to look impressive)

**Automatic Bullet Points** 📌  
Turns your paragraph of responsibilities into professional bullet points! Because "I did stuff" sounds better as "• Spearheaded innovative solutions."

**Conditional Sections** 🎭  
Experience section only shows if you have experience. Perfect for freshers who can finally stop lying about that "internship" from 2019.

**PDF Export (A4)** 📄  
Print-perfect, ATS-friendly, single-page resume. Will it get past the ATS? Probably not. But at least it'll look good while failing.

**Animated Background** ✨  
Flying alphabets and numbers because your resume needed more distractions. HR will love it. (They won't.)

## The Brutal Truth

**What this app promises:**  
A professional, ATS-friendly resume that showcases your skills perfectly.

**What it actually delivers:**  
A nicely formatted document that'll sit in a pile of 500 other identical-looking resumes while an algorithm decides your fate based on keywords you forgot to include.

## Pro Tips for Freshers

Since this is "useful for freshers":

- ✓ Use the conditional sections to hide your lack of experience
- ✓ Make your projects sound like you saved civilization
- ✓ Turn "made a to-do list app" into "architected scalable task management solution"
- ✓ List every technology you've heard of
- ✓ Pray the ATS gods are merciful

**Spoiler:** They're not. 💀

## Why A4 PDF Export Matters

Because apparently in 2025, we're still pretending people print resumes. But hey, at least it looks professional on screen while being ignored.

**ATS-Friendly?** Sure. As friendly as any system designed to reject 90% of applicants can be.

## The Reality of Job Hunting

This resume builder won't:
- Get you an interview
- Make up for your gaps in employment
- Explain why you switched careers 4 times
- Hide the fact you're overqualified/underqualified/incorrectly qualified
- Convince anyone your "hobbies" section is relevant

But it WILL:
- Look clean ✓
- Export properly ✓
- Let you feel productive while unemployed ✓
- Give you something to do between rejection emails ✓

**Q: Is the ATS-friendly claim real?**  
A: As real as any "ATS-friendly" claim can be. Meaning maybe, probably not, who knows.

**Q: Why build this when Canva exists?**  
A: Because I wanted to feel productive and this seemed easier than actually applying to jobs.
